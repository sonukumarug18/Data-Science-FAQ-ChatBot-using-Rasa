  - text: "Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business.
          It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from 
          the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering
          to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer
          questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results."

  utter_prerequisites:
  - text: "Prerequisites for data science can include:
          \n Mathematics, like probability, statistics, algebra, and calculus
          \n Object-oriented programming languages like Java, C, or Python
          \n Structured Query Language (SQL) for database queries"

  utter_education:
  - text: "Most data scientist roles will require at least a Bachelor's degree.
           Degrees in technical fields like computer science and statistics may be preferred,
